            <p className="text-xl">I'm a web developer with a passion for creating creative interfaces. 
My knowledge of Html, Css, Sass and Javascript, of frameworks such as 
such as React, Next.js and the Node.js environment, as well as my knowledge of motion 
motion design, graphics and animation software from the adobe suite, enable me to 
enable me to carry out a wide range of assignments. My background 
training as a classical musician has enabled me to develop a facility for 
to work as part of a team, to solve problems effectively and to put myself 
and to put myself at the service of the projects entrusted to me.
